## DNA unzipping curve prediction (GPU version )

### Instructions to Use (with Example Data)
1. The example genome is NEB H5alpha, the genbank file is in "examples" folder.
2. Run **parse_h5alpha.py** to parse the *200304_NEB_H5alpha_genbank.txt* and *200304_NEB_H5alpha.txt* to individual files. These files should be saved in folder "parsed"
3. Build the project on Windows. This .bat file will automatically run a test using the sequences in folder "parse"
```
> src/build.bat
```
4. To batch process sequence files, use this command
```
> main path/to/folder
```

(This is a learning project and my first time use CUDA ðŸ§¬)


### DNA unzipping theory

**DNA unzipping experiment on a 4.4 kb DNA**. The program's prediction (black) aligns well with a single-molecule unzipping curve (blue).
